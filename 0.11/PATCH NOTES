Version 0.11

Ok ignore the fact that the previous version was 0.01 and this is 0.11. The game is starting to take shape now. I have managed to implement
smooth animation of the ball. I just cut down the time increment of the ball and sped up the sleep cycles in the run() method. I wanted to 
implement multi-threading, but I gess this does the job for now. Multi-threading is a must and I need to implement that to add more 
features into the game. I managed to make a crude 'Proof-of-Concept' way of catching and throwing the ball. It works, but can be improved 
greatly. I need to implement inheritence and polymorphism, as I'm sick of hard-coding things in and need to make the future development 
more streamlined and hassle-free.

Issues from previous patches addressed:
- Ball movement needs to be smoothed out (Linear Depolarisation?) [v0.01]

Issues to address in upcoming patches:
- Make the ball catch and throw methods for the player be activated by just one button (Maybe VK_SPACE to catch the ball, then press 
  VK_SPACE again to throw the ball)
- Make the player jump and dash
- Add basketball hoops on each side of the court
- Flip the player raster image when running in the opposite direction
