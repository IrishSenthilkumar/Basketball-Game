Version 0.01

This is the very first version. I played a level called 'Extreme Basketball' in LitlleBigPlanet 2 on the PS3 ages ago. I'm going to try
and make that level in java. 
The Newtonian physics for the ball is done-ish. The player movement is only left and right for now. I'm trying to implement multi-threading
but I was never taught that so I have to learn it myself.

Issues to address in upcoming patches:
- Ball movement needs to be smoothed out (Linear Depolarisation?)
- Player and Ball need to be on SEPERATE THREADS.
